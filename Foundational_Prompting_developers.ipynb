    "complicated_murder_plot = \"The story takes place in the grand estate of a renowned business tycoon, Malcolm Hargrove. His sprawling mansion sits on the outskirts of a small, quiet town, far from prying eyes. It's the night of his annual charity gala, where the town's elite have gathered to celebrate the success of Hargrove Industries, a tech empire that dominates the market.As the evening unfolds, a series of strange occurrences begins to unfold. Guests whisper about Malcolm's deteriorating health; some say he's been acting strangely in the days leading up to the event, while others notice a certain tension in his interactions with a few of the attendees. The air is thick with the unspoken secrets of his past, but no one dares to voice them aloud.At midnight, a shrill scream echoes through the halls of the mansion. The guests rush to the source, finding Malcolm Hargrove’s lifeless body in his study, a single gunshot wound to his chest. The room is chaotic—papers scattered across his desk, a broken vase, and an open drawer suggest a struggle.The police are immediately called, but the guests are told to remain for questioning. Everyone is a suspect, but clues begin to emerge, each pointing to a different person, all subtly connected to Mr. Hargrove.Mrs. Hargrove, his wife, is found with a tear-streaked face, clutching a diamond bracelet. She claims she was in the garden when the murder occurred, but the bracelet was discovered on a table beside Malcolm’s body. She insists that she didn’t place it there, but the security footage shows her entering the study just minutes before the shot was heard.Detective Jenkins, a local investigator, was invited as a guest and initially takes control of the investigation. His presence seems odd to some, especially considering his long-standing feud with the Hargroves over a shady deal that once soured. He seems to know too much about the layout of the mansion and the timing of the crime, making some guests uneasy.Catherine Moore, Hargrove's former business partner, is visibly agitated, her fingers trembling when she’s asked where she was. She claims to have been in the ballroom, but witnesses report seeing her near the study moments before the gunshot rang out. Additionally, she and Malcolm had been seen arguing intensely just days before, their rivalry rooted in a bitter financial disagreement.Mr. Bradley, the charming but secretive tech consultant, appears calm and composed. He had been in the library throughout the evening, speaking with a few of the guests, but his demeanor is a stark contrast to the tense atmosphere in the house. His alibi is rock-solid, though his sharp eyes and analytical mind seem to always be observing everyone, picking up details others might miss.The detectives work tirelessly to piece together the puzzle. The murder weapon—a silver revolver—was found in the study, wiped clean of fingerprints. Oddly, it was registered to Mr. Bradley, a detail that throws suspicion on him. But, oddly enough, Mr. Bradley had only recently sold it to Malcolm Hargrove after a series of troubling encounters with it. No one can explain why it was so clean, and the fact that Bradley had been in the library does not seem to hold much weight.The breakthrough comes when an old ledger belonging to Malcolm is found in the study, showing irregular transactions—money funneled into a mysterious offshore account. The account is linked to a company run by Mr. Bradley’s long-lost cousin, a name not many knew but one that had been tied to shady dealings. Further inspection reveals that the transactions began after a heated conversation between Mr. Bradley and Malcolm over a failed project.A final, chilling clue is uncovered when a set of fingerprints—distinct and matching only Mr. Bradley's—is found on the broken vase. The vase had been shattered, its pieces scattered near the desk. The fingerprints on the shards suggest Mr. Bradley had been there long before the police arrived, though he denied ever touching the vase.All the clues lead back to Mr. Bradley—the bracelet, the gun, the fingerprints, the ledger, and the troubling financial connection. The police had already theorized that the murder was a result of a long-standing grudge over a failed business deal, but the evidence was too damning to ignore. \"\n",
