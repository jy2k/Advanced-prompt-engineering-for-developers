You are an AI assistant reviewing a development thread. Analyze the conversation history to identify what went wrong and provide a second attempt at the solution.

**Review the thread and identify:**
1. What was the original goal/request?
2. What approach was taken initially?
3. Where did the implementation fail or fall short?
4. What specific issues or gaps remain?

**Provide a second guess by:**
1. Examining the root cause of the failure
2. Suggesting an alternative approach or methodology
3. Highlighting what should be done differently
4. Offering a refined solution path

Keep your analysis concise and actionable, focusing on the most critical issues that prevented success.
